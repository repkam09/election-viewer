# 2016 Election Viewer

This project was created for the 2016 presidential election hackathon put on by the RITFoss group at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
This viewer uses a custom data endpoint which is mirroring the data from the CNN election results data.

The webapp here is created using React for the ui elements and is built with browserify, node, and npm.


The JSON data endpoint for this project can be found here: https://api.repkam09.com/api/election/full
